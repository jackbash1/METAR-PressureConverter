## Context

This application allows users to input a numeric floating value, and find the conversion from Hectopascals (hPa) -> Inches of Mercury (inHg), or vice versa, inHg -> hPa. These metrics are Atmospheric Pressure units, with Hectopascals being the commonly used unit to measure it in the UK and Europe. Inches of Mercury are commonly used in the United States for the same purpose. Within Aviation, this is specifically important, as Pilots rely on knowing the different pressure values wherever they are flying, so their instruments read the correct height above sea level. Consistency across aircraft is vital for safety and collision avoidance.

In an airline setting, this app provides consistent and up to date conversions between hPa and inHg. Different airlines often use different pressure metrics, which is why knowing the equivalent value is key. Pilots may use this when preparing for their flights, or Flight Planning may use it to understand the differences aceoss charts. Whilst this can be worked manually, it will not provide the level of accuracy that this app provides. 

## Features
The app contains the following features:
* The user is able to input the value they want to convert.
* The user is able to select the units that the outputted value will be in.
* To convert the value, there is a clickable button to carry out the conversion and display it back to the user underneath, alongside the original value.

## Project Management

Through this project, I have utilised GitHub Projects as the tool to manage my workflow and ensure I can adopt an Agile Way of Working. Project Management uses knowledge, skills and techniques to deliver something valuable, which in this is the app that I have created. Agile was the best way to work on this project as it offers an iterative approach to working that splits tasks into manageable "sprints". This also accounts for the variable nature of the tool, which could encounter bugs and require fixes on a interchangeable basis. Due to this way of working, I decided that Agile was better than a Waterfall approach. 

I worked in small sprints that each had a set of aims and tickets to accomplish before reviewing the progress in that sprint, and making changes ready for the next sprint. This is easier in a group of people, as there is limited room for reviewers and external reviewers that can help evaluate the sprint progress. During this time, I kept my tickets (issues) within the project Kanban board, shown above. This allowed me to break the project development into chunks, that could be assigned to a specific label, branch and pull request. It also helps for visualising the work that had to be complete, adding checklists within each ticket that could track my progress. There are 5 sections on the board, **Backlog, Ready, In Progress, In Review & Done**. At the start of each sprint, tickets within the Backlog are prioritised, and moved to Ready when included in that current sprint, and then moved as required throughout the sprint.

To ensure that I was maintaining Agile methodologies, each branch that I created also followed the naming convention of feature/fix/documentation / issue-name. This method prevented scope creep, as I could see the issue that I was working on throughout the process. Likewise, when change did occur, it was added to the sprint where required. Utilising this Agile methodology allows for changes, unlike a traditional Waterfall chart, which will restrict changes until completion, extending the development time. When I changed my design, based on UI feedback, I assessed the time scale and overall impact on the sprint, and decided it was manageable within the current sprint. If I was in a team environment, I would ensure that Scrum meetings are incorporated throughout the sprints, allowing each member of the team to share blockers with progress, and for the Scrum Master to update on the sprint and project progress, including change requests.
