## Context

![Design Prototype](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51112d4d-57fc-4259-bfa9-879fcd217b42)


This application allows users to input a numeric floating value, and find the conversion from Hectopascals (hPa) -> Inches of Mercury (inHg), or vice versa, inHg -> hPa. These metrics are Atmospheric Pressure units, with Hectopascals being the commonly used unit to measure it in the UK and Europe. Inches of Mercury are commonly used in the United States for the same purpose. Within Aviation, this is specifically important, as Pilots rely on knowing the different pressure values wherever they are flying, so their instruments read the correct height above sea level. Consistency across aircraft is vital for safety and collision avoidence.

In an airline setting, this app provides consistent and up to date conversions between hPa and inHg. Different airlines often use different pressure metrics, which is why knowing the equivalent value is key. Pilots may use this when preparing for their flights, or Flight Planning may use it to understand the differences aceoss charts. Whilst this can be worked manually, it will not provide the level of accuracy that this app provides. 

## Features
The app contains the following features:
* The user is able to input the value they want to convert.
* The user is able to select which direction the conversion occurs.
* To convert the value, there is a clickable button to carry out the conversion and display it to the user.
